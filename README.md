# Front-End-Challenge-Prepr

**Purpose**:

Your task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr Network. Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following pages (and possible sub-pages):

**Pages to redesign**: 

Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/)

Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects)

Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge)

Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge)

Labs page (https://preprlabs.org/joinedLab)

**Important Note**:

The site is not functionable and is not also responsive. The whole purpose of this was to redesign few of the pages that I was asked by Prepr.

**Final Take**:

Overall a great experience doing this. Took more time than I expected but I was able to meet the deadline and deliver it on time. Thank you Prepr for allowing me to recreate your site and because of you, I can add this to my resume :P
