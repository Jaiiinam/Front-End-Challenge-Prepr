# Front-End-Challenge-Prepr

**Purpose**:

Your task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr Network. Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following pages (and possible sub-pages):

**Pages to redesign**: 

Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/)

Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects)

Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge)

Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge)

Labs page (https://preprlabs.org/joinedLab)

**Important Note**:

The site is not functionable and is not also responsive. The whole purpose of this was to redesign few of the pages that I was asked by Prepr.
Most of the links cannot function however if appropriate instructions are followed, the site can fully function and be responsive.

**Suggestions**
Few Suggestions that should be considered. Icons should be added almost to every page. I personally think users are much more reactive to icons then they are to words. Also, adding a slider effect on the challegnes page using JSQuery will definetely make the site more attractive. Last but not least, the color of the site is too dull and too plain. Going with proper color trend and applying will definitely make the site look outstanding. These are few suggestions that I will apply if considered for this role.

**Final Take**:

Overall a great experience doing this. Took more time than I expected but I was able to meet the deadline and deliver it on time. Thank you Prepr for allowing me to recreate your site and because of you, I can add this to my resume :P
