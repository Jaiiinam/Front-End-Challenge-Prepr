# Front-End-Challenge-Prepr

**Purpose**
Your task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr Network. Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following pages (and possible sub-pages):

**Pages to redesign**
Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/)
Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects)
Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge)
Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge)
Labs page (https://preprlabs.org/joinedLab)

**Important Note**
The site is not functionable and is not also responsive. The whole purpose of this was to redesign few of the pages that I was asked by Prepr.
